//! Core gRPC types common to clients and servers.
//!
//! This module provides the fundamental types used in gRPC communication, such
//! as message traits.
//!
//! Most applications should not need to use these types directly, as they are
//! typically used by generated code.  However, they may be necessary when
//! implementing custom interceptors or advanced features.
//!
//! # Key Concepts
//!
//! - **[`SendMessage`] / [`RecvMessage`]:** Traits for encoding and decoding
//!   messages.
