/// Includes generated proto message, client, and server code.
///
/// You must specify the path to the `.proto` file
/// **relative to the proto root directory**,  without the `.proto` extension.  
///
/// For example, if your proto directory is `path/to/protos` and it contains the
/// file  `helloworld.proto`, you would write:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// mod pb {
///     grpc::include_proto!("path/to/protos", "helloworld");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Note
/// **This macro only works if the gRPC build output directory and message path
/// are unmodified.**
/// By default:
/// - The output directory is set to the [`OUT_DIR`] environment variable.
/// - The message path is set to `self`.
///
/// If your `.proto` files are not in a subdirectory, you can omit the first
/// parameter.
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// mod pb {
///     grpc::include_proto!("helloworld");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you have modified the output directory or message path, you should
/// include the generated code manually instead of using this macro.
///
/// The following example assumes the message code is imported using `self`:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// mod protos {
///     // Include message code.
///     include!("relative/protobuf/directory/generated.rs");
///
///     // Include service code.
///     include!("relative/protobuf/directory/helloworld_grpc.pb.rs");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If the message code and service code are in different modules, and the
/// message path specified during code generation is `super::protos`, use:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// mod protos {
///     // Include message code.
///     include!("relative/protobuf/directory/generated.rs");
/// }
///
/// mod grpc {
///     // Include service code.
///     include!("relative/protobuf/directory/helloworld_grpc.pb.rs");
/// }
/// ```
