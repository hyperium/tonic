A rust implementation of [gRPC], a high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first.

[`tonic`] is a gRPC over HTTP/2 implementation focused on high performance, interoperability, and flexibility. This library was created to have first class support of async/await and to act as a core building block for production systems written in Rust.

## Overview

[`tonic`] is composed of three main components: the generic gRPC implementation, the high performance HTTP/2
implementation and the codegen powered by [`prost`]. The generic implementation can support any HTTP/2
implementation and any encoding via a set of generic traits. The HTTP/2 implementation is based on [`hyper`],
a fast HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 client and server built on top of the robust [`tokio`] stack. The codegen
contains the tools to build clients and servers from [`protobuf`] definitions.

## Features

- Bi-directional streaming
- High performance async io
- Interoperability
- TLS backed by [`rustls`]
- Load balancing
- Custom metadata
- Authentication
- Health Checking

## Getting Started

Examples can be found in [`examples`] and for more complex scenarios [`interop`]
may be a good resource as it shows examples of many of the gRPC features.

If you're using [rust-analyzer] we recommend you set `"rust-analyzer.cargo.buildScripts.enable": true` to correctly load
the generated code.

For IntelliJ IDEA users, please refer to [this](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/8056) and enable
`org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts`
[experimental feature](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust/docs/rust-faq.html#experimental-features).

### Rust Version

`tonic`'s MSRV is `1.60`.

```bash
$ rustup update
$ cargo build
```

### Dependencies

In order to build `tonic` >= 0.8.0, you need the `protoc` Protocol Buffers compiler, along with Protocol Buffers resource files.

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev
```

#### Alpine Linux

```sh
sudo apk add protoc protobuf-dev
```

#### macOS

Assuming [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is already installed. (If not, see instructions for installing Homebrew on [the Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).)

```zsh
brew install protobuf
```

#### Windows

- Download the latest version of `protoc-xx.y-win64.zip` from [HERE](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/latest)
- Extract the file `bin\protoc.exe` and put it somewhere in the `PATH`
- Verify installation by opening a command prompt and enter `protoc --version`

### Tutorials

- The [`helloworld`][helloworld-tutorial] tutorial provides a basic example of using `tonic`, perfect for first time users!
- The [`routeguide`][routeguide-tutorial] tutorial provides a complete example of using `tonic` and all its
features.
