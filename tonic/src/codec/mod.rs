/// Settings for how tonic allocates and grows buffers.
///
/// Tonic eagerly allocates the buffer_size per RPC, and grows
/// the buffer by buffer_size increments to handle larger messages.
/// Buffer size defaults to 8KiB.
///
/// Example:
/// ```ignore
/// Buffer start:       | 8kb |
/// Message received:   |   24612 bytes    |
/// Buffer grows:       | 8kb | 8kb | 8kb | 8kb |
/// ```
///
/// The buffer grows to the next largest buffer_size increment of
/// 32768 to hold 24612 bytes, which is just slightly too large for
/// the previous buffer increment of 24576.
///
/// If you use a smaller buffer size you will waste less memory, but
/// you will allocate more frequently. If one way or the other matters
/// more to you, you may wish to customize your tonic Codec (see
/// codec_buffers example).
///
/// Yield threshold is an optimization for streaming rpcs. Sometimes
/// you may have many small messages ready to send. When they are ready,
/// it is a much more efficient use of system resources to batch them
/// together into one larger send(). The yield threshold controls how
/// much you want to bulk up such a batch of ready-to-send messages.
/// The larger your yield threshold the more you will batch - and
/// consequently allocate contiguous memory, which might be relevant
/// if you're considering large numbers here.
/// If your server streaming rpc does not reach the yield threshold
/// before it reaches Poll::Pending (meaning, it's waiting for more
/// data from wherever you're streaming from) then Tonic will just send
/// along a smaller batch. Yield threshold is an upper-bound, it will
/// not affect the responsiveness of your streaming rpc (for reasonable
/// sizes of yield threshold).
/// Yield threshold defaults to 32 KiB.
