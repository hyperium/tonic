//! A Rust implementation of [gRPC], a high performance, open source, general
//! RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first.
//!
//! [`tonic`] is a gRPC over HTTP/2 implementation focused on **high
//! performance**, **interoperability**, and **flexibility**. This library was
//! created to have first class support of async/await and to act as a core building
//! block for production systems written in Rust.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Examples can be found in the [`tonic-examples`] crate.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! Follow the instructions in the [`tonic-build`] crate documentation.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! - `transport`: Enables the fully featured, batteries included client and server
//! implementation based on [`hyper`], [`tower`] and [`tokio`]. Enabled by default.
//! - `codegen`: Enables all the required exports and optional dependencies required
//! for [`tonic-build`]. Enabled by default.
//! - `tls`: Enables the `rustls` based TLS options for the `transport` feature. Not
//! enabled by default.
//! - `tls-roots`: Adds system trust roots to `rustls`-based gRPC clients using the
//! `rustls-native-certs` crate. Not enabled by default. `tls` must be enabled to use
//! `tls-roots`.
//! - `tls-webpki-roots`: Add the standard trust roots from the `webpki-roots` crate to
//! `rustls`-based gRPC clients. Not enabled by default.
//! - `prost`: Enables the [`prost`] based gRPC [`Codec`] implementation.
//! - `compression`: Enables compressing requests, responses, and streams. Note
//! that you must enable the `compression` feature on both `tonic` and
//! `tonic-build` to use it. Depends on [flate2]. Not enabled by default.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! ## Generic implementation
//!
//! The main goal of [`tonic`] is to provide a generic gRPC implementation over HTTP/2
//! framing. This means at the lowest level this library provides the ability to use
//! a generic HTTP/2 implementation with different types of gRPC encodings formats. Generally,
//! some form of codegen should be used instead of interacting directly with the items in
//! [`client`] and [`server`].
//!
//! ## Transport
//!
//! The [`transport`] module contains a fully featured HTTP/2.0 [`Channel`] (gRPC terminology)
//! and [`Server`]. These implementations are built on top of [`tokio`], [`hyper`] and [`tower`].
//! It also provides many of the features that the core gRPC libraries provide such as load balancing,
//! tls, timeouts, and many more. This implementation can also be used as a reference implementation
//! to build even more feature rich clients and servers. This module also provides the ability to
//! enable TLS using [`rustls`], via the `tls` feature flag.
